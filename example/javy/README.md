# Javy Introduction

[Javy](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy) is a toolchain launched by Bytecode Alliance that can compile JavaScript code into WebAssembly (Wasm) modules. It is suitable for scenarios that need to run JS code in Wasm environments, supports ECMAScript 2020 standard, and is based on WASI specification.

## Installing Javy

1. Go to [Javy Releases](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy/releases) to download the precompiled binary file for your operating system.
2. Extract and add the `javy` executable to your environment variables (optional).

## Writing JS Example

The `index.js` example in this directory

## Compiling JS to Wasm

```shell
javy build index.js -o index.wasm
```

## Running Wasm Module

Recommended to use [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime):

```shell
echo '{"n": 1, "bar": "hello"}' | wasmtime index.wasm
```

Output example:
```
{"foo":2,"newBar":"hello!"}
```

## Notes
- Wasm generated by Javy only supports WASI environment, cannot run directly in browsers.
- Only supports stdin/stdout for input/output.
- Does not support Node.js/Promise/async and other advanced JS features.
- Suitable for data processing, computation scenarios.
